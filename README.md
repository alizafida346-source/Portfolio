You are a senior front-end developer. I already have a GitHub Pages portfolio with this structure:

portfolio/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── README.md

Task: Update ALL site content to match my real CV data below. Keep the design modern, responsive, clean, and academic-professional. Do NOT add frameworks. Use only HTML5/CSS3/vanilla JS. Keep smooth scrolling + sticky nav + mobile hamburger menu.

Important requirements:
- Replace ALL placeholder text, dummy links, and fake sections with my real data.
- Create sections in this order: Home, About, Education, Experience, Projects, Publications, Skills, Certificates, Contact.
- Add a clear “Current Research” highlight box under About.
- Add a downloadable CV button (link to "cv.pdf"). If cv.pdf doesn’t exist, still add the button and note in README how to add it.
- Make the content concise and professional (not too long).
- Ensure phone number and email are clickable (tel: and mailto:).
- Add location (Siena, Italy).
- Add a small footer: “© 2026 Aliza Fida. All rights reserved.”
- Update README.md to reflect the correct publication URL and correct setup steps for GitHub Pages.
- Fix the GitHub Pages URL: it should match repository publishing rules (avoid hardcoding a wrong path). Use relative links.
