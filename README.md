You are a senior front-end developer and UX designer specializing in academic and engineering portfolios.

Create a modern, visually striking, responsive personal website for a PhD-level Electrical Engineer specializing in RF, Microwave Engineering, and Infrared Metalenses.

The design must:
- Feel high-tech, clean, and research-driven
- Use a dark + deep blue gradient theme with subtle glow accents (engineering aesthetic)
- Include smooth scrolling, sticky navigation, and subtle fade-in animations
- Be fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Use only HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Follow accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, aria labels, focus states, contrast compliance)

The website must include the following sections in order:

1. HERO SECTION
- Name prominently displayed: Aliza Fida
- Title: PhD Researcher | Electrical Engineer (RF, Microwave & Infrared Metasurfaces)
- Location: Siena, Italy
- Short, powerful tagline:
  "Engineering electromagnetic waves from RF systems to infrared metasurfaces."
- Two buttons:
  - View Research
  - Download CV (link to cv.pdf)

2. ABOUT
Rewrite this summary to sound impactful and confident:

Original:
Dedicated electrical engineer with a clear understanding of electrical power systems, RF & Microwave domains. Strong work ethic and willingness to learn new processes and techniques that enhance team efforts.

Make it more compelling, technical, and research-oriented.

3. CURRENT RESEARCH HIGHLIGHT (featured section with visual emphasis)
PhD in Information Engineering (2024–present)
University of Siena, Italy
Research:
Mechanical Beam Steering in the Infrared Range Using a Rotatable Triple Metalens

Make this section visually distinct (card or highlighted container).

4. EDUCATION (timeline style layout)
- PhD in Information Engineering — University of Siena (2024–present)
- MSc Electrical Engineering (RF & Microwave), NUST (2017–2020), CGPA 3.31/4
  Thesis: Single-layer metasurface-based broadband absorber
- BSc Electrical Power Engineering, NFC-IET Multan (2012–2016), CGPA 3.44/4
  Project: Two-way smart energy meter
- FSC Pre-Engineering
- O’ Level

5. EXPERIENCE
Format professionally and concisely:
- Teaching Assistant — NUST EME Rawalpindi (2017–2018)
- Teaching/Academic Assistance — Govt Girls Primary School Trust Colony, Bahawalpur
- Field Exposure — Muzaffargarh Thermal Power Station

Do not fabricate dates or details.

6. PROJECTS (grid layout with hover effects)
- Metasurface-based broadband absorber (CST)
- Microstrip patch antenna & T-shaped Chile’s RFID resonator
- Stepped-impedance microstrip Low Pass Filter (ADS)
- RF MEMS inductor
- Power divider
- Water level detector

Each project should have a short 1–2 line technical description.

7. PUBLICATIONS
- Anti-reflecting metasurface for broadband polarization-independent absorption at Ku band frequencies — Scientific Reports
- Beam Steering Based on Pancharatnam-Berry Metalenses — Accepted, EuCAP 2026

Format cleanly and academically.

8. TECHNICAL EXPERTISE (categorized layout)
- EM/Microwave: CST, HFSS, ADS
- Programming/Software: MATLAB, LaTeX, AutoCAD, C++
- Test & Measurement: Spectrum Analyzer, Network Analyzer, EMC/EMI, Anechoic Chamber Radiation Measurement
- Fabrication: Antennas, Metasurfaces, Microstrip Filters

Use skill bars or visual indicators (but keep professional, not flashy).

9. CERTIFICATIONS
List neatly.

10. CONTACT SECTION
- Phone: +39 339 210 9107 (clickable)
- Email: alizafida346@gmail.com (clickable)
- GitHub: https://github.com/alizafida346-source
- LinkedIn: Add your LinkedIn URL

Add a professional footer:

DELIVERABLES:
- Provide complete code for:
  - index.html
  - style.css
  - script.js
  - README.md
- Ensure clean file structure
- Include GitHub Pages deployment instructions
- Keep animations subtle and elegant
- Avoid clutter
- Maintain academic professionalism

The final website should feel like a researcher in advanced electromagnetics and metasurfaces — not a generic resume.
